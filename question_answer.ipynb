      "\n",
      "1. Line following land rover: A robot that follows a fixed path by detecting a line. The robot's direction of motion depends on the two sensors' outputs. When the two sensors are on the line of the path, the robot moves forward. If the left sensor moves away from the line, the robot moves towards the right. Similarly, if the right sensor moves away from the path, the robot moves towards its left. Whenever the robot moves away from its path, it is detected by the IR sensor.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Cell phone operated land rover: In this project, the robot is controlled by a mobile phone that makes a call to the mobile phone attached to the robot. In the course of a call, if any button is pressed, a tone corresponding to the button pressed is heard at the other end of the call. This tone is called ‘dual-tone multiple-frequency’ (DTMF) tone. The robot perceives this DTMF tone with the help of the phone stacked in the robot.\n"
